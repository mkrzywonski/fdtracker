## 4. Install Python, Pip, and Set Up a Virtual Environment

1. Ensure Python and pip are installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

---

## 5. Install Dependencies

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 6. Install Gunicorn

1. Install Gunicorn for running the application:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

---

## 7. Set Up the Systemd Service

1. Create a Systemd unit file for the application:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/fdtracker.service
   ```
   Add the following content:
   ```bash
    [Unit]
    Description=Flask FDTracker Service
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    # Update these to the correct user/group on your system.
    User=fd
    Group=fd

    # The working directory for the service
    WorkingDirectory=/home/fd/fdtracker

    # Make sure the PATH points to your virtual environmentâ€™s bin folder
    Environment="PATH=/home/fd/fdtracker/.venv/bin"

    # The command to start your Flask app via Gunicorn
    ExecStart=/home/fd/fdtracker/.venv/bin/gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:5000 app:app

    # Automatically restart if the service crashes
    Restart=always

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

## 9. Set Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

1. Install Nginx:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```
2. Create an Nginx configuration file for the application:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/fdtracker
   ```
   Add the following content:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name fdtracker.local;
       client_max_body_size 1G;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }
   ```
3. Enable the configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/fdtracker /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```
4. Test the Nginx configuration:
   ```bash
